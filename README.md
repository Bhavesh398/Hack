Problem Statement
ps 12 :AI for Grievance Redressal in Public Governance
Problem Statement
Public governance bodies receive thousands of citizen grievances every day, covering issues such as civic
infrastructure, sanitation, public safety, utilities, healthcare, education, and administrative delays.
These complaints are typically:
Unstructured (free-text, voice notes, mixed languages)
Manually reviewed and routed
Slow to resolve, leading to backlogs, citizen dissatisfaction, and lack of accountability
The absence of intelligent prioritization and analysis causes critical grievances to be delayed, while
authorities struggle to gain actionable insights from large volumes of complaint data.
There is a pressing need for an AI-powered grievance redressal system that can intelligently understand,
categorize, and prioritize citizen complaints to enable faster, fairer, and more transparent governance.
Objective
Design and develop an AI-driven grievance redressal platform using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
intelligent automation that can:
Automatically analyze and classify citizen complaints
Prioritize grievances based on urgency, severity, and impact
Route complaints to the appropriate department or authority
Assist government bodies in resolving issues efficiently and transparentl
